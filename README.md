# Decentralized Charity Donation Platform

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in charitable donations using blockchain technology. Our Decentralized Charity Donation Platform leverages Ethereum smart contracts to track and manage donations, ensuring that every contribution is visible and accountable.

## Features
- **Transparent Donations**: Every donation is recorded on the blockchain, offering complete transparency.
- **Owner Withdrawal**: Only the designated owner of the contract can withdraw funds, ensuring control and security.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Donors can see real-time updates of their contributions and the total funds raised by the charity.

## Technology Stack
- **Ethereum**: Smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Solidity**: The smart contracts are written in Solidity.
- **Hardhat**: Used for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ethers.js**: A library used to interact with Ethereum in the frontend.
